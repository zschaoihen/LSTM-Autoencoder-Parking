# Incorporating LSTM Auto-encoders in Optimisations to Solve Parking Officer Patrolling Problem

## Contents of the repository
This repository contains resources used and described in the paper.

The repository is structured as follows:


- `Optimisation/`: Include the optimisation algorithm implementation.
- `AutoEncoder/`: Include the LSTM Auto-encoder implementation.
- `data/`: Dataset used for this paper.

## Code
All codes are implemented using Python3. 

## Data
Please noted that the structure of this repository is revised so the path of the data files might need to be changed to run the code.
